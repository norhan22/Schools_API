## **MVC**
- **MVC** is short for **M**odel, **V**iew, and **C**ontroller.
- It's an **architectural pattern** that separates an application into three main
  logical components Model , view and controller 
  - **Model** that part of the application that ( handles || stores )** data** and its related logic
  - **View** that part of the application that represent  the presentation of data (**UI components**).
  - **Controller** is that part of the application that handles the **user interaction**

<br/>
<br/>

*Example from daily life* :


<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/1/122118_0445_MVCTutorial2.png">
        
        View = You
        Waiter = Controller
        Cook = Model
        Refrigerator = Data

<br/>

***So, to sum it up:***

- **Model** is data part.
- **View** is User Interface part.
- **Controller** is request-response handler.
